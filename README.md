# Ray Tracing Engine

This repo consists of a basic ray-tracing engine in C++ 11.0.

Supports basic render functionality such as:

- anti-aliasing
- material diffusion

Coming next:
- Port to CUDA framework!

This was built by following [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) as well as [_Accelerated Ray Tracing in One Weekend in CUDA_](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/).
